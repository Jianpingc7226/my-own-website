  <h1>Eliminate</h1>

  <p class="text">
    Do not evolve in time, perish in time
 In nature, anyone who cannot adapt to the environment will be eliminated. For 
 example, during the beginning of the Ice Age, many mammals could not adapt to 
 environmental changes and died.

  Of course, not all creatures are able to adapt to change. For those surviving 
creatures such as the ancestral mammoth of elephants, their offspring will 
gradually evolve some characteristics that can allow them to survive in the cold 
(such as fur). Degraded some traits they didn't need.
  We humans are also an example of a plan, our ancestors were monkeys. They 
evolved their fingers for better climbing on trees, and wisdom teeth for better 
chewing (though now only causing us to have dental caries). But at the same time 
we also lost something, because we no longer need to climb trees to find fruit.

  <h1>Evolution</h1>

  <p class="text">
Evolution is a change without direction. 
It can be from simple to complex 
evolution, or from complex to simple 
degradation. The main mechanism of 
evolution is hereditary variation of 
organisms, as well as the adaptation of 
organisms to the environment and 
competition among species. The process 
of natural selection will cause the 
characteristics of species to be 
retained or eliminated, and even new 
species will be born or existing species will become extinct. Today's biologists believe that all life on Earth comes from a common ancestor formed more than 3 billion years ago, and that biology has continuously evolved since then. To this day, there are an estimated 13,500,000 species in the world.</p>

  <p class="text">
The evolution of tadpoles in biology refers to the changes in hereditary traits between generations. The so-called trait refers to the performance of genes, which are transmitted to the offspring through replication during reproduction. Gene mutations can change traits or produce new traits, which can cause genetic variation among individuals. New traits are passed through the population because of migration or horizontal gene transfer between species. When these genetic variations are affected by non-random natural selection or random genetic drift, and become more common or rare in ethnic groups, it means that evolution has occurred.
