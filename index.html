  <h1>Eliminate</h1>

  <p class="test">
    Do not evolve in time, perish in time
 In nature, anyone who cannot adapt to the environment will be eliminated. For 
 example, during the beginning of the Ice Age, many mammals could not adapt to 
 environmental changes and died.

  Of course, not all creatures are able to adapt to change. For those surviving 
creatures such as the ancestral mammoth of elephants, their offspring will 
gradually evolve some characteristics that can allow them to survive in the cold 
(such as fur). Degraded some traits they didn't need.
  We humans are also an example of a plan, our ancestors were monkeys. They 
evolved their fingers for better climbing on trees, and wisdom teeth for better 
chewing (though now only causing us to have dental caries). But at the same time 
we also lost something, because we no longer need to climb trees to find fruit.
