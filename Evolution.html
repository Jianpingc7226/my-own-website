  <h3>Evolution does not have a definite direction. It can evolve from simple to complex, or it can degenerate from complex to simple. Evolution is mainly produced by the variation of bio-inheritable genes. The adaptation of organisms to the environment and competition between species will also affect the occurrence of evolution. The process of natural selection will cause the characteristics of species to be preserved or eliminated, or even the birth of new species or the extinction of original species. Biologists today believe that all life on Earth comes from a common ancestor that was formed more than 3 billion years ago, and then living things have continued to evolve. To this day, there are an estimated 13,500,000 species in existence in the world.

The theory explaining evolution is evolution, although Lamarck, famous for his use of advancement and retreat theory, was one of the earliest biologists who established evolution as a science. But the concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest proposed by Darwin and Wallace were the theories accepted by later biologists. In Darwin's book "The Origin of Species", natural selection was first proposed as a mechanism of evolution.

Due to the conflict between the concept of evolution and religious beliefs, especially the origin of human beings, it has led to a lot of controversy on the religious, social and philosophical level from the Darwin era to the present.</h3>
