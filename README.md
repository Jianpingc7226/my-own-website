## Context
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about Students use the content learned in daily courses to create their own web pages. The purpose of this blog is to reflect upon your learning.

## Content
For my project, I am making a website about evolution using Github, HTML, CSS, and research. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying extinction and evolution and making the website.

## Implications
This website is about the connection between evolution, environment and extinction. This website allows people to better understand how organisms have evolved to this day, how organisms in the past have perished, and the impact of the environment on evolution.
